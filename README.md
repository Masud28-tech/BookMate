# BookMate Application

## Overview

It is a full-stack application. That helps the user to manage book collections and engage with other book-loving users. 
Features:
Users can register for accounts with secure email validation and log in safely. They can manage their booksâ€”creating, updating, sharing, or archiving them. The system handles book borrowing, ensuring eligibility, and facilitates returns, which require approval for completion.

## Features

- Designed and implemented a class diagram based on business requirements using a mono repo approach. 
- Secured the application with JWT tokens, managed user registration, and validated accounts via email. 
- Implemented the service layer, handled exceptions, and validated objects using Spring Validation. 
- Documented APIs with OpenAPI and Swagger UI, Dockerized the infrastructure, and set up a CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
